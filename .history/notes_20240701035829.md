# autoPOT.cpp
I feel like it would be good to add a "dead zone" to this. Example could be: `autoPot pot1(5)` and this would set a value of 5, so unless the pot moves above or below that value, It would not trigger.

If it is a raw value, then it would be: `lastReading = 1000, if newValue > 5, value = newVal, callback(value)` Then we can do the same thing for less then the dead zone.
**Thinking lines 30 ish would be where this goes in at.**

- Add mapped values, for lower and higher limit.
- Add a smoother paramiter.
- Add a timer, so its not constently polling.
- Dead zone to limit data.

❗ Add a example for autoPOT

# mapper.cpp
❗ Make an example or 3 on how to use it properly.

# lists.cpp
❗Example needed.

# MultiMap.cpp
❗Example needed.
